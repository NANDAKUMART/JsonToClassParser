# JsonToClassParser
<b>Prerequisite:-</b><br/>
	Before going thorough this branch, check out the master branch's readme.md file for more info.
	
<b>What's new in this latest update?</b><br/>
   Well, still the same restriction done in the master will apply to this one too.
   
   But over here, there are some addons have been added.
   
   1. Equivalent Class Structure for the Json Structure (- No change here, as this is in master branch)
   2. Equivalent Object initialization code for the generated class (New addon)
   3. Runtime generated object with equivalent values given in the json (New addon)
   
<b>Hey, this is already done, What the hell u did something new here?</b><br/>
   Yes, there is already NewtonSoft, DataContract api's are there. I did not do anything anything new here. I have written just a code base which can be used by anyone. 
   
<b>Any Samples available for this new changes?</b><br/>
   Yes. Here you go.<br/><br/>

<b>What change can I see in another repo?</b><br/>
